# Ryuuko â€” Discord LLM Bot

**Ryuuko** is a modular and extensible Discord bot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It's designed to be a versatile chatbot that can be customized and extended with new commands and functionalities.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend the bot by adding new commands, events, or services.
*   **LLM Integration**: Connects with LLM providers for intelligent conversation.
*   **Conversation Memory**: Remembers previous messages in a conversation for better context.
*   **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system using environment variables and a `config.json` file.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict commands to authorized users.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses a request queue to handle LLM API calls without blocking the bot.
