# Ryuuko â€” Discord LLM Bot

**Ryuuko** is a modular and extensible Discord bot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It's designed to be a versatile chatbot that can be customized and extended with new commands and functionalities.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend the bot by adding new commands, events, or services.
*   **LLM Integration**: Connects with LLM providers for intelligent conversation.
*   **Conversation Memory**: Remembers previous messages in a conversation for better context.
*   **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system using environment variables and a `config.json` file.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict commands to authorized users.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses a request queue to handle LLM API calls without blocking the bot.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   MongoDB server
*   A Discord Bot Token

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    # To install testing dependencies as well
    pip install .[test]
    ```

3.  **Configure the bot:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your secrets. For a full list of required API keys, see the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md).
        ```env
        # Discord and Database
        DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"
        MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_mongodb_connection_string"

        # LLM API Keys (only add the ones you use)
